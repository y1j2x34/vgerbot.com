# MVC, MVP, MVVM

## Godfrey Nolan 演讲笔记

### MVC

#### 什么样才是MVC

```mermaid
graph LR
    View --> Model
    View --> Controller
    Controller --> View
    Controller --> Model
```

```sequence
User --> View: User Gesture
View-->Controller: Invoke Action
Controller-->Model: Execute Requested Task
Model-->View: Notify Changes
View-->Model: Ask for Changes
Model-->View: Updated Model
View --> View: refresh
```


#### MVC的优缺点

##### 优点

- No Business logic in UI
- Easier to unit test

##### 缺点

- Doesn't scale, separates UI but not model
- Controller often grows too big
- Violates Single Responsibility, Interface Segregation SOLID principles
